# ECE505-Lab-3---UART-and-GPIO
This lab utilizes UART and GPIO to interact and read the on-board temperature sensor and control the on-board RGB LED.

This lab demonstrates a simple enviornmental monitoring unit.  This 
program will read the internal analog temperature sensor on the TivaWare
Launchpad development board through the onboard ADC.  The temperature will
then be converted to Celsius and Farenheit and printed to the console.  
The program also takes user input to toggle the red, green, and blue LEDS.
